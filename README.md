# Static Blog Image Downloader
Download images to output on building. It helps make image load faster while keep git repo size small.

## Usage
For vercel, change build command to `curl "https://static.ihc.im/image-downloader-musl" --output image-downloader && chmod +x image-downloader && ./image-downloader && hexo g`.
